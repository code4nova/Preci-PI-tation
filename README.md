# Preci-PI-tation

Preci-PI-tation is an interdisciplary learning project to use a Raspberry Pi
connected to a moisture sensor and a valve operating a water source to
automatically water a plant over an extended period of time, like a teacher
going away for Summer vacation perhaps.

The project will involve the collaboration among knowledgable folks from the
following disciplines:

* computer programming
* electronics
* engineering
* horticulture
